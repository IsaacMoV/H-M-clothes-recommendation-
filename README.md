# H&M Clothes Recommendation System

This project is a recommendation system for clothing items based on the **H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations** dataset. The goal is to provide tailored suggestions to users by leveraging various machine learning approaches.

## Dataset
The data used in this project was obtained from Kaggle's [H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations) competition.

## Methodology
The project implements and compares several supervised learning techniques to determine the most effective model for this recommendation task:
* **XGBoost**
* **Naive Bayes**
* **Random Forest**
* **Linear Regression**

The performance of these models is evaluated and compared based on their accuracy and other relevant metrics to find the best fit for the catalog.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Pandas / NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost
